# Hello! I'm Stephane Lapointe ☁️
<h3 align="center">Principal Azure Architect at GSoft | Microsoft Azure MVP</h3>

## About me
Stephane (That's me 👋) ([a Microsoft Azure MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001613)) is born and raised in the Microsoft ecosystem and Azure. I started my career in 1996. Did development for 17 years in various Microsoft programming languages and did DevOps before it was even called that. I started with Azure end of 2011 and stuck with it ever since. The changing reality of the cloud is very exciting and a never-ending area for continuous learning and experiments. 

I am a Principal Azure Architect at [GSoft](https://www.gsoft.com), a Montreal-based software company. I am helping with everything that is Azure related and part of a team that empower teams to craft robust, resilient & scalable software. 🚀

I love solving problems, helping others, thinking broader and further... this is what drives me.
